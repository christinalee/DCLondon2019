                      <p>In one study by Eleanor Maguire about people studying for the taxi exam in London, she found that “the volume of the posterior hippocampi had gotten significantly larger in the group of trainees who had continued their training and had become licensed taxi drivers.” The taxi drivers had literally bulked up the part of their brain responsible for navigation, in turn increasing their capacity to navigate.</p>

                      <p>Specifically what practice gives us is mental models. Experts have practiced enough to build up sophisticated mental models that allow them to make more informed decisions, faster than someone who hasn’t trained. This is where their apparent ease comes from. As we’ll discuss later, it is a bit easier for them to process information in their area of expertise. </p>

                      <p>One way this was studied was via soccer players. A scenario was set up where the researchers would play a clip of a game, and then pause it as the ball got to a player’s foot. They would then quiz the participants on what they thought would happen next and where certain players were located on the field or doing at the moment the game was stopped. They found:</p>

                      <p>The reason having mental models is important to expertise is because it allows for easier encoding and retrieval. Without a mental model, a student needs to encode information piece by piece. When it comes time to retrieve it, they must also do so piece by piece, placing them at the whim of their short term memory’s capacities.</p>

      <p>“If you teach a student facts, concepts, and rules, those things go into long-term memory as individual pieces, and if a student then wishes to do something with them—use them to solve a problem, reason with them to answer a question, or organize and analyze them to come up with a theme or a hypothesis—the limitations of attention and short-term memory kick in. The student must keep all of these different, unconnected pieces in mind while working with them toward a solution. However, if this information is assimilated as part of building mental representations aimed at doing something, the individual pieces become part of an interconnected pattern that provides context and meaning to the information, making it easier to work with.”</p>

                      <p>The best part is that having a mental model makes it easier to learn new information which in turn strengthens the mental model, creating a virtuous cycle in which the more expertise you build up, the easier it is to gather expertise, the more you build up, and on and on. </p>

                      <p>Now if “getting as close as possible” doesn’t seem very inspired, I assure you it is far more effective than you might believe. In another field without a quantifiable definition of mastery, teaching, approximating deliberate practice caused students in that section to learn twice as much compared to students in the control section of the course which continued to be taught in standard lecture format. </p>

                      <p>If this doesn’t seem ridiculous to you, think about professional sports. Imagine a rugby player playing an entire season, and then on the last day of the season, the coach sits them down and gives feedback on all the things they did wrong or right over the last 8 months. Then they pat them on the back, ask them to fix those things, and the player goes off to play another entire season before they meet once again the next year. </p>

      <p>This is, of course preposterous. And it’s how it often works right now in our industry. </p>

                      <p>So how can you fake this for yourself? The author Anders Ericsson suggests that one way to do this is to set up your own monthly performance reviews. Create goals, and then check in on them (honestly and ruthlessly) each month.</p>

                      <p>Or start using code reviews as deliberate practice— pinpoint a specific skill you’re learning and ask your coworkers to give you feedback on it every time you put up a diff. Remember, the more specific the skill you identify, the more efficient this process will be, and you should have a way to identify progress against the skill. </p>

                      <p>You can do similar things in meetings. If you, like me, are into public speaking, you might be interested in reducing filler words in your speech such as “uhm” and “so”. Tell your coworkers and have them slightly raise a hand every time you use a filler word in a meeting, or have them tally the number of times on a piece of paper. You don’t have to stop speaking or disrupt your flow, but you’ll be getting feedback that measures your progress. Focus on reducing the number of filler words each meeting. </p>

                      <p>But overcoming this discomfort and building this skill will pay dividends. There is some research that shows that self discipline, such as the discipline built and used by deliberate practice, more accurately predicted academic performance than IQ.</p>

                      <p>Further, the feats achievable through deliberate practice are staggering. In one study researchers recruited patients with presbyopia, which is a problem resulting from the eye losing elasticity in the lens that makes it difficult to focus on nearby objects. They had these subjects come into the lab and practice spotting faint dots on a background several times a week. At the end of a three month practice period, on average subjects were able to read letters 60% smaller, and were able to read them faster than before. Every subject was also able to read a newspaper without glasses, which was something most of them were unable to do before the practice sessions. What is remarkable here is that the physical issue with the elasticity of the eye’s lens was still there, but the patients were able to train their brain to better process the fuzzy signals the eye was sending it to compensate.</p>

      <p>Note: this is not to suggest that all physical maladies can be overcome with training. It is a single example to illustrate that deliberate practice can achieve great improvements even in areas where improvement is hard. </p>

                      <p>Worst of all, because knowledge work is nebulous and hard to measure, busyness has increasingly become a proxy for demonstrating value. If you as an individual try to break the interruption cycle by not coming to the office, not attending meetings, and not answering slack or emails, it is highly likely your boss and coworkers will believe you are slacking off and being unproductive. Even if the solitude allows you to do more deep thinking, the lack of busyness cues is likely to come at a social cost. </p>

                      <p>Further, a study that followed office workers in their places of work and timed their activities showed that interruptions, even when short, lengthen the total time to complete a task by a significant amount. Coupled with the last point, this means interruption rates like the ones cited by Dr Mark are causing workers to be prone to poorer performance and take longer on tasks than is otherwise needed, which is something even the most cynical business owners should be worried about. </p>

                      <p>Thus, if we continue to deplete our attention centers while at home by checking emails or performing work, and do not allow them the time to replenish (replicated in the study via walking through nature, but possible to achieve in a variety of leisure activities), we run the risk of reducing our ability to concentrate the following day, undermining our ability to get work done. </p>

                      <p>This is how things go from “real bad” to catastrophic. There is a tremendously good book by Matthew Walker called “Why We Sleep” that I personally think is one of the most perspective altering books I’ve ever read. I highly, highly recommend everyone read it. Dr Walker (PhD) outlines enough findings in the book to occupy several keynotes, but I’ll highlight just a few to illustrate the point.</p>

                      <p>Among research cited in the book, you will find ones that show:</p>

      <p>A 40% increase cancer risk in those sleeping 6 hours or less compared to 7 hrs or more1</p>

      <p>That a society which transitioned form socially ingrained support for afternoon naps (for which we are biologically wired) to a social expectation of staying awake and working through the afternoon hours caused a 60% increase in mortality risk among male working populations.2</p>

      <p>The WHO has classified nighttime shift work as a probable carcinogen3</p>

      <p>__________________________</p>

      <p>1: “A large European study of almost 25,000 individuals demonstrated that sleeping six hours or less was associated with a 40 percent increased risk of developing cancer, relative to those sleeping seven hours a night or more.”</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>2: “However, those that abandoned regular siestas went on to suffer a 37 percent increased risk of death from heart disease across the six-year period, relative to those who maintained regular daytime naps. The effect was especially strong in workingmen, where the ensuing mortality risk of not napping increased by well over 60 percent.</p>

      <p>__________________________</p>

      <p>1: “There was a clear, linear relationship with infection rate. The less sleep an individual was getting in the week before facing the active common cold virus, the more likely it was that they would be infected and catch a cold. In those sleeping five hours on average, the infection rate was almost 50 percent. In those sleeping seven hours or more a night in the week prior, the infection rate was just 18 percent.”</p>

                      <p>Lack of sleep will spike endocannabinoids in your brain, giving you the munchies and making you susceptible to weight gain.1, 2, 3</p>

      <p>__________________________</p>

      <p>1: “The less you sleep, the more you are likely to eat. In addition, your body becomes unable to manage those calories effectively, especially the concentrations of sugar in your blood. In these two ways, sleeping less than seven or eight hours a night will increase your probability of gaining weight, being overweight, or being obese, and significantly increases your likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes.”</p>

      <p>Walker, Matthew. Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams (p. 169). Scribner. Kindle Edition. </p>

      <p>2: “When your sleep becomes short, you will gain weight. Multiple forces conspire to expand your waistline. The first concerns two hormones controlling appetite: leptin and ghrelin.II Leptin signals a sense of feeling full. When circulating levels of leptin are high, your appetite is blunted and you don’t feel like eating. Ghrelin, in contrast, triggers a strong sensation of hunger. When ghrelin levels increase, so, too, does your desire to eat. An imbalance of either one of these hormones can trigger increased eating and thus body weight. Perturb both in the wrong direction, and weight gain is more than probable.”</p>

      <p>Walker, Matthew. Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams (pp. 171-172). Scribner. Kindle Edition. </p>

      <p>3: “Of relevance to this behavior is a recent discovery that sleep loss increases levels of circulating endocannabinoids, which, as you may have guessed from the name, are chemicals produced by the body that are very similar to the drug cannabis. Like marijuana use, these chemicals stimulate appetite and increase your desire to snack, otherwise known as having the munchies.Combine this increase in endocannabinoids with alterations in leptin and ghrelin caused by sleep deprivation and you have a potent brew of chemical messages all driving you in one direction: overeating.”</p>

      <p>__________________________</p>

      <p>1: “After being awake for nineteen hours, people who were sleep-deprived were as cognitively impaired as those who were legally drunk. Said another way, if you wake up at seven a.m. and remain awake throughout the day, then go out socializing with friends until late that evening, yet drink no alcohol whatsoever, by the time you are driving home at two a.m. you are as cognitively impaired in your ability to attend to the road and what is around you as a legally drunk driver. In fact, participants in the above study started their nosedive in performance after just fifteen hours of being awake (ten p.m. in the above scenario).</p>

                      <p>Removing REM sleep removes the ability to read the social world accurately and results in up to a 60% increase in amygdala activity when showed emotionally charged images compared to a much more measured response to such images when well rested1, 2</p>

      <p>__________________________</p>

      <p>1: “With the absence of such emotional acuity, normally gifted by the re-tuning skills of REM sleep at night, the sleep-deprived participants slipped into a default of fear bias, believing even gentle- or somewhat friendly looking faces were menacing. The outside world had become a more threatening and aversive place when the brain lacked REM sleep—untruthfully so. Reality and perceived reality were no longer the same in the “eyes” of the sleepless brain. By removing REM sleep, we had, quite literally, removed participants’ levelheaded ability to read the social world around them.”</p>

      <p>Walker, Matthew. Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams (pp. 216-217). Scribner. Kindle Edition. </p>

      <p>2: “Analysis of the brain scans revealed the largest effects I have measured in my research to date. A structure located in the left and right sides of the brain, called the amygdala—a key hot spot for triggering strong emotions such as anger and rage, and linked to the fight-or-flight response—showed well over a 60 percent amplification in emotional reactivity in the participants who were sleep-deprived. In contrast, the brain scans of those individuals who were given a full night’s sleep evinced a controlled, modest degree of reactivity in the amygdala, despite viewing the very same images. It was as though, without sleep, our brain reverts to a primitive pattern of uncontrolled reactivity. We produce unmetered, inappropriate emotional reactions, and are unable to place events into a broader or considered context.”</p>

                      <p>It turns out that sleeping just 7hrs a day for less than two weeks decreases your performance to levels you’d see after an all nighter. Further, a weekend’s worth of sleep is not enough to correct the effect.1</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>Also if you’re now thinking “I sleep 7 hrs daily and I’m not acting impaired, there’s no way this is true”, that’s probably due to the additional fact that the same research showed us that “the human mind cannot accurately sense how sleep deprived it is when it is sleep-deprived”2</p>

      <p>__________________________</p>

      <p>“We can find evidence for this claim in the research of Clifford Nass, the late Stanford communications professor who was well known for his study of behavior in the digital age. Among other insights, Nass’s research revealed that constant attention switching online has a lasting negative effect on your brain. Here’s Nass summarizing these findings in a 2010 interview with NPR’s Ira Flatow: </p>

      <p>So we have scales that allow us to divide up people into people who multitask all the time and people who rarely do, and the differences are remarkable. People who multitask all the time can’t filter out irrelevancy. They can’t manage a working memory. They’re chronically distracted. They initiate much larger parts of their brain that are irrelevant to the task at hand… they’re pretty much mental wrecks. </p>

      <p>At this point Flatow asks Nass whether the chronically distracted recognize this rewiring of their brain: </p>

      <p>The people we talk with continually said, “look, when I really have to concentrate, I turn off everything and I am laser-focused.” And unfortunately, they’ve developed habits of mind that make it impossible for them to be laser-focused. They’re suckers for irrelevancy. They just can’t keep on task. [emphasis mine] </p>

      <p>Once your brain has become accustomed to on-demand distraction, Nass discovered, it’s hard to shake the addiction even when you want to concentrate.”</p>

                      <p>One way to get around the harm done to your brain by trying to multitask all the time is to start scheduling your distractions time instead of scheduling your time away from distractions. Let your default state become focused time and schedule your next distraction break in advance (i.e. decide you’ll work for an hour and then check your phone). The bonus here is that the time you spend resisting checking your phone before the hour is up acts like mental calisthenics for your brain, building your ability to resist and focus. </p>

                      <p>When studying memory athletes, researchers found that the key difference between them and ordinary people was that they had a heightened ability to concentrate. Thus, if we want to become better at concentrating, one way we can likely boost our abilities in this area is by training in the same ways as memory athletes. The author Cal Newport suggests starting with the common memory feat of learning to memorize an entire deck of cards.</p>

      <p>______________________</p>

      <p>“We found that one of the biggest differences between memory athletes and the rest of us is a in a cognitive ability that’s not a direct measure of memory but of attention” … “A side effect of memory training in other words is an improvement in your general ability to concentrate”</p>

                      <p>However, researchers “found that they could significantly reduce the effect’s impact by asking the subjects, soon after the interruption, to make a plan for how they would later complete the incomplete task.” It appears that attention residue can be at least partially mitigated by making a plan for completing a task at the time of interruption. Thus, we can employ this knowledge to our benefit by mitigating any inevitable interruptions in our workplace by writing down our own unfinished items before switching to the new task.</p>

                      <p>Further, this suggests that it might be beneficial to employ a shutdown ritual at the end of work each day to symbolically close out the day and allow your brain to transition into leisure mode. Doing so could allow us to reduce the attention residue of unfinished work tasks following us into our leisure time. Making this transition faster stands to benefit us by maximizing the amount of time at home where our brain is relaxed enough to replenish its attention centers, preparing us to pay attention the following day. </p>

      <p>1:  “Among young people, the group perhaps most concerned with the role of work in their lives, 64 percent now say that they’re actively unhappy in their jobs. This is the highest level of dissatisfaction ever measured for any age group over the full two-decade history of the survey4. In other words, our generation-spanning experiment with passion-centric career planning can be deemed a failure: The more we focused on loving what we do, the less we ended up loving it.”</p>

                      <p>If you are a manager, by and large you should be thrilled by the lack of research based support for the passion hypothesis and the rigorous data on SDT primarily because all three of the SDT factors can be augmented by a good manager, unlike passion, which you cannot gift someone.</p>

                      <p>However, beware this gift is EXTREMELY fragile. The fact that managers have direct influence over worker’s sense of autonomy is great in one way, because it means they can adjust it to make workers happier and multiply their output. But on the other hand, this makes brathletes extremely susceptible, as even an elite athlete can be easily undermined if paired with a coach who is not operating optimally. And this is far easier to do with a sense of autonomy than you might think, as it’s surrounded by quite a few unintuitive gotchas.</p>

                      <p>For instance in one study in Sweden, people were less likely to give blood when paid for it than when not, unless they were also given the option to donate the money to a charity, in which case they were as likely to give blood as the unpaid group1. The act of trying to reward these blood donators robbed them of their sense of joy in doing something good “just because”.</p>

      <p>1: “They’d shown up, which indicated intrinsic motivation. Getting a few kronor on top might give that impulse a boost. But—as you might have guessed by now—that’s not what happened. In this group, only 30 percent of the women decided to give blood. Instead of increasing the number of blood donors, offering to pay people decreased the number by nearly half. Meanwhile, the third group—which had the option of donating the fee directly to charity—responded much the same as the first group. Fifty-three percent became blood donors. Titmuss’s hunch might have been right, after all. Adding a monetary incentive didn’t lead to more of the desired behavior. It led to less. The reason: It tainted an altruistic act and “crowded out” the intrinsic desire to do something good.”</p>

                      <p>Well intentioned rewards can undermine people in other ways as well. In addition to robbing us of our feeling of autonomy (as we saw on the previous slide), rewards can also cause us to narrow our focus and miss solutions. Specifically, offering high financial rewards results in lower levels of creative thinking, as measured by studies such as the candle problem, in which the higher the reward offered on a task requiring creative thinking, the slower the participants were to find the answer.</p>

      <p>________________________</p>

      <p>“In direct contravention to the core tenets of Motivation 2.0, an incentive designed to clarify thinking and sharpen creativity ended up clouding thinking and dulling creativity. Why? Rewards, by their very nature, narrow our focus. That’s helpful when there’s a clear path to a solution. They help us stare ahead and race faster. But “if-then” motivators are terrible for challenges like the candle problem. As this experiment shows, the rewards narrowed people’s focus and blinkered the wide view that might have allowed them to see new uses for old objects.”</p>

                      <p>But I make this point not to convince everyone to change how they give rewards, but primarily to show that motivation, which I’m using here as proxy for passion, can be extremely unintuitive at times. It is unlikely that someone would have guessed ahead of time that paying participants more money to solve problems would slow them down, or that offering people money for blood donations would make them less likely to donate. </p>

      <p>And given that rewards are often administered by managers, this should let us know how important the manager/employee relationship can be to our own performance, motivation, and happiness. We can be an elite brathletes, putting into practice all of the recommended habits, but be woefully undermined in our pursuit if our manager is not applying the same rigor to their craft. Managers, like ICs, cannot simply “try harder”. Informed, deliberate practice with accurate feedback is every bit as important for them as it is for ICs, because the skills they are managing are just as cognitively demanding and can have outsized impacts on productivity.</p>
